# fewshot-diffusion-low-memory
Fewshot diffusion methods for gpu machines without 12gb of ram. On my computer, I can't run latent diffusion without significantly
shrinking the diffusion model. The solution I had was to use Open AI's glide model and adapt it to set encoding from https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15463.
